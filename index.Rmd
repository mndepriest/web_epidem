### About

These materials have been developed for teaching plant disease epidemiology on any level. Besides this the idea is to inspire potential learners to acquire some coding and quantitative skills, which are in need in the world of plant diseases. Here we introduce a very popular tool in the world of statistics and data science, the R language.\
Very similar materials exist on [APS website](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/Pages/default.aspx) and here we tried to refresh these resources using newer software. One of main ideas is to add the interactive element which allows learners to explore these concepts on the go.
